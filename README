dpsprep - Sony Digital Paper DJVU to PDF converter

---------------------------
This tool implements a suite of procedures to make completely functional PDFs from djvu files.
The djvu technology is strikingly superior for many ebook applications, yet the Sony Digital Paper System (rev 1.3 US)
only supports PDF technology as its primary design purpose is *NOT* as an ereader.  The device, however, is the **perfect** ereader 
with just two modifications:

* 2 page thumbnail view
* bookmark jump while in viewed page mode (instead of the special annotations list)

(And another wonderful modification would be split screen mode with viewer on top and notepad on the bottom)

Unfortunately, all presently available djvu to pdf tools seem to just dump flattened enormous TIFF images.  This is ridiculous.  
Since PDF really can't do that much better on the way it stores image data, a 5-6x bloat cannot be avoided.  However, none of the 
existing tools preserve:

* the (OCRd?) selectable text content
* Table of Contents or Internal links
* Metadata

This is kind of silly, but until Sony's Digital Paper, there was no need to move functional DJVU files to PDFs. 
In order to make workable PDFs from djvu files for use on the Digital Paper System, I have implemented in one location the following 
procedures detailed here:

By automating the procedure of user zetah for extracting the text and getting it in the correct locations:

By implementing the procedure of user pyrocrasty for extracting the outline, and putting it into the PDF generated above:

Note that gem install ona Ubuntu system will require these packages:
sudo apt-get install libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev
